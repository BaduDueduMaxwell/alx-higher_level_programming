# Python Network #0 - Project Overview

## Project Description

This project is focused on understanding and manipulating HTTP requests and responses. You will learn how to use  to interact with web servers, understand the structure of HTTP requests, and get hands-on experience with different HTTP methods such as GET, POST, and DELETE. The project also includes a task to find a peak in a list of unsorted integers as part of technical interview preparation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand what a URL is and how to read it.
- Understand HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and its components.
- Differentiate between domain names, sub-domains, and port numbers.
- Recognize the components of an HTTP request and response, including headers, methods, and status codes.
- Use  to make HTTP requests.
- Explain what happens when you type a URL like  into your browser.

## Project Structure

The project contains several tasks, each designed to reinforce the concepts mentioned above. Each task will require you to write Bash scripts or Python functions, as outlined below.

## Tasks

1. **cURL body size**

   - **File:** 

2. **cURL to the end**
   - Write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a GET request, and displays the body of the response if the status code is 200.
   - **File:** 

3. **cURL Method**
   - Write a Bash script that sends a DELETE request to a specified URL and displays the body of the response.
   - **File:** 

4. **cURL only methods**
   - Write a Bash script that takes in a URL and displays all HTTP methods the server will accept.
   - **File:** 

5. **cURL headers**

   - **File:** 

6. **cURL POST parameters**
   - Write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a POST request with specific parameters ( and ), and displays the body of the response.
   - **File:** 

7. **Find a peak**
